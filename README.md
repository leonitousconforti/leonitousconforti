- 👋 Hi, I’m Leo Conforti
- 👀 I’m interested in web development, fintech, and robotics
- 🌱 I’m currently learning typescript + effect-ts + react
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a full stack web application that promotes and ennables trading of in-game items for the mobile game TinyTower
- ⭐ My favorite project I've worked on recently has been efffrida
- 🏗️ I'm mostly building at [git.ltgk.net/explore](https://git.ltgk.net/explore) nowadays (personal gitlab instance where I keep my "experimental" projects)
- 📫 You can reach me at leo@leoconforti.us or confo014@umn.edu
- 🌐 On the web, I'll be located at [leoconforti.us](http://leoconforti.us) (when I get around to making a portfolio site)
- 🎓 I studied computer science at umn.edu when I wasn't on the soccer field or marathon training

5/20/2025 My house (duplex) burned down last week (thankfully no one was injured, also not my fault it was the neighbors) but I still don't have any compute / infra to restore my backups to at this time so no gitlab, programming, etc for right now.

Studied computer science at umn.edu . I've worked in software development across the stack and in numerous programming languages; from embedded robotics projects (c, c++) to high performance job-shop schedulers (F#, .Net world, Angular) to full-stack analytics websites and trading platforms (TypeScript, Node, React/Next.Js). Along with my work experience, I also contribute to open source.
